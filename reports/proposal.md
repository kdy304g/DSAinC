# BetterHash

## Team Members: Danny Kang, Manu Patil

## Goal
**Lower bound**: Our lower bound goal is to implement several different data structures. We will start with a hash table implementation. We will also look into an implementation of an Graph Data Structure. <br>

**Upper Bound**: We will produce a robust API for testing the time complexity of operations using these algorithms. We will try to push the limits of our hash function and attempt to optimize the hashing function. A super stretch goal will be to visualize the algorithms that we explore and produce <br>

## Learning Goals
For this project, our primary learning goal is to learn more in depth about data structures in C. We plan to implement several different types of data structures. We hope to have a deeper understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. We also expect to have to make some important design decisions in our implementation.

## Initial Steps
**Team**:
  Look into video resources describing the relevant data structures. <br>
  Create Hash table function <br>
  Research different Hashing Functions <br>
